# fxhash-viewer

A browser-based viewer for **fxhash** generative art, designed to keep working **after fxhash itself disappears**.

It resolves artwork bytes directly from where they actually live — **onchfs** (on-chain file system) and **IPFS** — and runs the original generator in a sandboxed iframe. No fxhash servers are involved at view time.

> **Status:** work in progress (pre-1.0). Currently private while the rough edges are smoothed out.

## Why

fxhash stores generative artworks as content-addressed files (onchfs on EVM chains, IPFS on Tezos and elsewhere). The official viewer, however, reaches those files through fxhash's own gateways and APIs. The day those endpoints go offline, the art stops loading — even though the bytes are still on-chain / on IPFS forever.

This project removes every runtime dependency on fxhash:

> If `fxhash.xyz`, `media.fxhash.xyz`, `onchfs.fxhash2.xyz`, and `api.v2.fxhash.xyz` all stopped responding tomorrow, this viewer would still load the same artworks correctly.

See [`_legacy/onchfs-viewer/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./_legacy/onchfs-viewer/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full on-chain investigation notes the design is based on.

## Features

- **Content-addressed resolution** — reads artwork files straight from onchfs (Ethereum / Base) and IPFS, never from fxhash endpoints.
- **Resilient transports** — multiple public RPCs (viem `fallback`) and a racing/sticky pool of IPFS gateways, so no single provider is a point of failure. Large onchfs files are read chunk-by-chunk to stay under `eth_call` gas limits.
- **Service Worker rendering** — a SW intercepts `/view/{scheme}/{cid}/…` and serves the artwork (and its sub-resources) with the same environment patches fxhash applies (e.g. the `Math.pow` base58 determinism fix), so generators render identically.
- **Two ways to load** — paste an `onchfs://` / `ipfs://` URI directly, or load a project JSON and pick an iteration from a thumbnail grid.
- **Offline archive** — export any artwork you've viewed as a self-contained `.zip` (all files + a standalone launcher), so it survives even if every gateway disappears.
- **Persistent cache** — resolved bytes are cached in IndexedDB; once seen, an artwork loads fully offline.

## How it works

```
URI / project JSON
        │
        ▼
  parse onchfs:// or ipfs://
        │
        ▼
  iframe src = /view/{scheme}/{cid}/?fxhash=…&fxiteration=…&chain=…
        │
        ▼
  Service Worker (sw.js)
   ├─ resolve bytes  ── onchfs (viem)  or  IPFS (gateway race)
   ├─ inject patches (Math.pow / <base> / crossOrigin)
   └─ cache (IndexedDB)
        │
        ▼
  sandboxed iframe runs the original generator
```

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+**
- A modern browser with Service Worker support

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run build      # builds the app AND the Service Worker (sw.js)
npm run preview    # serves the production build at http://localhost:4173
```

Open the printed URL.

> **Use `build` + `preview`, not `dev`.** The Service Worker (`/sw.js`) is a separate build artifact and only exists after `npm run build`. Under `npm run dev` it 404s, so artwork rendering won't work.

Other scripts:

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | Type-check, build the app, then build `sw.js` (dynamic imports inlined) |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check only |

## Usage

**URI mode** — choose the chain, paste an `onchfs://…` or `ipfs://…` URI, fill in the generation `fxhash` seed (and optionally iteration / minter), and hit **Load**.

**File mode** — load a project JSON (see below). Saved projects under `public/projects/` appear in the sidebar; pick an iteration from the thumbnail grid to view it.

## Preparing artwork data (optional)

The viewer works without any bundled data (URI mode resolves anything directly). To browse a whole project by thumbnail, extract its iteration list into `public/projects/`:

```bash
# EVM (Ethereum / Base) project, by contract address or metadata file
node extract-project.mjs <contract-address> [ethereum|base]

# Tezos project, by name
node extract-tezos.mjs --name "Project Name"

# Resolve a project name / fxhash URL to its contract address
node find-contract.mjs "Project Name"
```

Each writes `public/projects/<Name>.json` and refreshes `public/projects/_index.json`, which the File-mode sidebar reads. These scripts use only on-chain / public-indexer data and Node built-ins (no extra dependencies). Extracted data is **git-ignored** — it's content, not source.

## Supported chains & storage

| Chain | Storage in practice | How it's read |
|---|---|---|
| Ethereum | onchfs (on-chain) | viem `readContract`, chunked for large files |
| Base | onchfs / IPFS | viem / gateway |
| Tezos | IPFS | gateway race (via the `onchfs` package's resolver) |

## Project structure

```
src/
  resolver/    onchfs + IPFS resolution (chunked reads, gateway race)
  cache/       IndexedDB content cache
  sw/          Service Worker (intercepts /view/*) + registration
  archive/     ZIP export of viewed artworks
  discovery/   shared ArtworkItem type (live wallet discovery intentionally dropped)
  App.tsx      UI (File / URI modes)
extract-*.mjs  offline data-extraction tools
_legacy/       reference: the original prototype + ARCHITECTURE notes

## Configuration

Optional — copy `.env.example` to `.env` to use your own RPC endpoints (they take priority over the public fallbacks):

```
VITE_ETH_RPC=
VITE_BASE_RPC=
```
